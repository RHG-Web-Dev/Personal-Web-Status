**Issue identified:** The host has once again dropped the container and the online status of all bots will slowly fall under the guidelines I keep for the bots.  {{< track "2020-06-15 18:26:27" >}} \
**Monitoring:** We decided to part from the current host and move to another. We are watching the performance of the two bots. {{< track "2020-07-01 05:00:00" >}}\
**Fixed:** Everything should be back online and running normally.. {{< track "2020-09-10 05:00:00" >}}
