Both bots have received major down time due to the host dropping container availability.\
**Issue identified:** Our hosting company has informed us of a failure in the host containers. They are working on it.  {{< track "2020-05-30 14:23:00" >}} \
**Monitoring:** The host in question has been notified. We are monitoring the hosts for the next few weeks to be sure all is OK. {{< track "2020-05-30 18:52:00" >}}
