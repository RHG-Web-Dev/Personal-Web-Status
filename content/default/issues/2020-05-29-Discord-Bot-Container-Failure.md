Both bots have received major down time due to the host dropping container availability.\
**Issue identified:** Our hosting company has informed us of a failure in the host containers. They are working on the problem.  {{< track "2020-05-30 14:23:00" >}} \
**Monitoring:** The host has said they had a hot fix, but we are still monitoring the host for the next few weeks to be sure all is OK. {{< track "2020-05-30 18:52:00" >}}\
**Update:**  The host is monitoring their efforts to stabilize the system. The site should be operational at this time. {{< track "2020-05-31 09:52:00" >}}\
**Update:**  The host is continuing to monitor for any further issues. {{< track "2020-06-01 09:52:00" >}}

**Update:**  The host has marked the incident as resolved, but we are continually having problems keep the bots online. {{< track "2020-06-03 21:00:00" >}}

**Resolved?:**  For the past days I've been monitoring the bots and I've just hit a breaking point and moved to a new container. {{< track "2020-06-08 1:00:00" >}}
