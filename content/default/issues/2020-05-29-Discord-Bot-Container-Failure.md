Both bots have received major down time due to the host dropping container availability.\
**Issue identified:** Our hosting company has informed us of a failure in the host containers. They are working on the problem.  {{< track "2020-05-30 14:23:00" >}} \
**Monitoring:** The host as said they had a hot fix, but we are still monitoring the host for the next few weeks to be sure all is OK. {{< track "2020-05-30 18:52:00" >}}\
**Update:**  The host is monitoring their efforts to stabilize the system. The site should be operational at this time. {{< track "2020-05-31 09:52:00" >}}\
